# Bash Tips: Calendar & Date

I just learned about this tiny utility within Bash. It's nothing special, but just loved how easy and how clean it was.

Within a terminal window, executing the `cal` command will provide you with a calendar. The following is an example:

```
> cal
   December 2019      
Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa  
 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  
 8  9 10 11 12 13 14  
15 16 17 18 19 20 21  
22 23 24 25 26 27 28  
29 30 31 
```


Also within a terminal window, executing the `date` command will provide you with a formatted datetime string. 
```
> date
Mon Dec  2 14:06:58 CET 2019
```
